        ### Item Comparison Report

        **Overview:**

        This report in P-Shopper provides insights into the items you've purchased over a selected timeframe. You can view details such as the most bought item, the date when you bought the most items, the most popular category, the total quantity of items purchased, and your total spending.

        **How It Works:**

        - **Select a Timeframe:** Choose whether you want to see the data by week, month, or year using the radio buttons.
        - **View the Report:** The report will display the most purchased item, the date when you bought the most items, the most popular category, the total quantity of items purchased, and your total spending for the selected timeframe.

        **Calculations:**

        - P-Shopper identifies the item you bought the most during the selected timeframe.
        - It determines the specific date within the timeframe when you bought the most items.
        - The report shows the category with the highest quantity of items bought.
        - It sums up the total quantity of items you bought.
        - It calculates the total amount you spent on these items.

        **Example:**

        If you choose "Week," you'll see the most bought item, the date when you bought the most items, the most popular category, the total quantity of items purchased, and your total spending for the past week.
