        ### Weekly Spending Comparison Report

        **Overview:**

        This report in P-Shopper provides a week-by-week comparison of your spending over the past year. It helps you see how your spending changes from week to week, noting any increases or decreases.

        **How It Works:**

        - **View the Report:** The report will display your spending for each week, showing the total spending, the change in spending from the previous week, and the percentage change.

        **Calculations:**

        - P-Shopper sums up the prices of all items you bought each week.
        - It calculates the difference in total spending between the current week and the previous week.
        - It determines the percentage change in spending from the previous week.

        **Example:**

        If you look at the report, you'll see your total spending for each week, along with the changes in spending and percentage changes compared to the previous week.
