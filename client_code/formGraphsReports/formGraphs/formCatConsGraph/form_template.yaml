        ### Category Consumption Graph

        **Overview**:
        - This graph in P-Shopper shows how many items you've purchased in a specific category over time. You can view this data weekly, monthly, or yearly.

        **How It Works**:
        - **Select a Category**: Choose a category from the dropdown list.
        - **Choose a Timeframe**: Select whether you want to see the data by week, month, or year using the radio buttons.
        - **View the Graph**: The graph will display the total quantity of items purchased in the selected category for each time period.

        **Calculations**:
        - P-Shopper adds up all the items you've bought in the chosen category for each week, month, or year.
        - It then shows this total on the graph, helping you see trends over time.

        **Example**:
        - If you choose "Vegetables" and "Month," you'll see how many vegetables you bought each month over the past year.
