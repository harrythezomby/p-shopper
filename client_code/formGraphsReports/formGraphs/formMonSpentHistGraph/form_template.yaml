        ### Money Spent History Graph

        **Overview**:
        - This graph in P-Shopper shows how much money you've spent over time. You can view this data weekly, monthly, or yearly.

        **How It Works**:
        - **Choose a Timeframe**: Select whether you want to see the data by week, month, or year using the radio buttons.
        - **View the Graph**: The graph will display the total amount of money you spent for each time period.

        **Calculations**:
        - P-Shopper adds up the cost of all items you bought for each week, month, or year.
        - It then shows this total amount on the graph, helping you see your spending patterns over time.

        **Example**:
        - If you choose "Year," you'll see how much money you spent each year over the past five years.
