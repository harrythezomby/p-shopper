        ### Item Price History Graph

        **Overview**:
        - This graph in P-Shopper shows how the price of a specific item has changed over time. You can view this data weekly, monthly, or yearly. If there are multiple prices for the same item in the same timeframe, the graph shows the average price per quantity.

        **How It Works**:
        - **Select an Item**: Choose an item from the dropdown list.
        - **Choose a Timeframe**: Select whether you want to see the data by week, month, or year using the radio buttons.
        - **View the Graph**: The graph will display the average price you paid for the selected item for each time period.

        **Calculations**:
        - P-Shopper calculates the price per quantity for each purchase of the chosen item.
        - If you bought the item multiple times in the same week, month, or year, P-Shopper averages these prices.
        - The graph shows these average prices, helping you track how the cost of the item changes over time.

        **Example**:
        - If you choose "Milk" and "Month," you'll see the average price per quantity of milk each month over the past year.
