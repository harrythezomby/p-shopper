# Welcome to P-Shopper!

## Note to Developers:
If testing/playing around with the app in a development environment, such as straight from an Anvil clone link, make sure to follow the standard account creation steps present within the app itself. This is because P-Shopper performs a variety of tasks behind the scenes upon new user accounts being created, which has to do setting up graphs and reports, as well as creating a default list for the new user. If this isn't done, errors _will_ be encountered, so please keep this in mind!

# Creating List Items

P-Shopper provides an intuitive way to add new items to your shopping list:

# Items Expiring Soon
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62f8a937-ce25-4ce0-9f9a-0fffd2fd40c2)

At the bottom of the P-Shopper screen, you may notice a message indicating items that are expiring soon. This feature helps you stay on top of your perishable goods and ensures you use them before they go bad.

### How It Works

# Deprecated Features

In the development of P-Shopper, certain features were considered but ultimately deprecated. One notable example is the list sharing functionality. Hereâ€™s an explanation of this feature and the reasons why it was not implemented:

## List Sharing

### Initial Concept
- **Purpose**: The list sharing feature was intended to allow users to generate a unique URL for their shopping lists. This URL could be shared with others, enabling them to view the list without needing to log in to P-Shopper.
- **Functionality**: Users would be able to click a "Share" button to generate a URL. If sharing was active, users could also opt to unshare the list.

### Implementation Challenges
- **Security Concerns**: Ensuring that shared lists were accessible only to intended recipients while maintaining user data privacy proved complex. Implementing secure, temporary URLs that couldn't be exploited was challenging.
- **User Experience**: Providing a seamless experience where shared lists were easily accessible without compromising the overall app's functionality was difficult. Issues arose in maintaining the app's integrity and user flow when accessing shared lists.
- **Technical Limitations**: Handling URL hashes and ensuring correct list loading without user login required significant changes to the app's core structure. This introduced potential instability and complexity that outweighed the benefits.

### Decision to Deprecate
- **Focus on Core Features**: To maintain a high-quality user experience, the development focus shifted to enhancing the core features of P-Shopper, such as item management, sorting, filtering, and reporting.
- **Security and Privacy**: Prioritizing the security and privacy of user data was paramount. Given the challenges in securely implementing list sharing, it was decided to deprecate this feature to ensure user trust and data protection.
- **Resource Allocation**: The development resources were better allocated to features that directly improved the usability and functionality of the app, rather than maintaining a complex sharing system.

### Future Considerations
- **Possible Revisit**: While list sharing is not currently supported, it may be revisited in the future if a secure and user-friendly implementation can be devised.
- **Alternative Sharing Methods**: Users are encouraged to use the export functionality to share lists. Exporting lists as CSV files provides a simple and secure way to share shopping data without compromising privacy or security.

By focusing on the essential features and ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience, P-Shopper continues to provide effective and reliable shopping list management. The decision to deprecate list sharing reflects a commitment to quality and user satisfaction.
